            <p>George Platt is a Lancashire lad who has ended up in Mongolia. He studied Chemistry at Durham University and then became a lecturer, but let’s hear George tell us all about it:</p>
            <blockquote>“I currently serve overseas (Mongolia) as a short-term (one year) cross cultural missionary, having been sent by three sending Churches and the missionary fellowship Interserve. My ministry involves lecturing chemistry at an international missionary-founded university (Mongolia International University) which seeks to bring the gospel to students in Mongolia, most of which come from a Buddhist or shamanistic background (though there are sizeable population of Christians and missionary kids at the university too). Hence, beyond lecturing, I mostly involve myself with student outreach, Bible studies, missionary meetings, newsletter writings, mentoring and accountability sessions.”</blockquote>

            <p>George applied to our <b>ministry training scheme</b> because of our heart for church planting and Reformed theology. He also has a deep passion for sharing the gospel with international students and has been involved in the Manchester International Outreach (MIO) team.
            In his spare time George is interested in politics and enjoys being involved in theatre productions. He enjoys cooking, walks and playing his ukulele.</p>

            <p>We’re hoping to appoint one or two more trainees so watch the space for more details.

            <p>Membership has always been a <span class="uk-text-bold">key ministry</span> of City Church. But, as the church has grown it is easier than for visitors and even committed attendees to be anonymous or struggle to find a pathway into church life. <span class="uk-text-bold">FLOW</span> ministry exists to equip those attending City Church to enjoy Christ by intentionally providing pathways of <span class="uk-text-bold">integration into the life</span> of the church. Whether that be enjoying Christ in community with believers, enjoying Christ on a service teams, enjoying Christ at midweek connect groups, or enjoying Christ as an official member of City Church, we wish to <span class="uk-text-bold">invite everyone</span> who walks through our doors to <span class="uk-text-bold">enjoy Christ</span> in all aspects of the church.</p>
          <p>
            Practically we run <span class="uk-text-bold">monthly welcome lunches</span>, <span class="uk-text-bold">quarterly membership classes</span>, and act as <span class="uk-text-bold">a hub</span> for social, service team, and ministry connections throughout the church. <span class="uk-text-bold">Clint Harper</span> will be our new Connections Director launching this new ministry officially from September 2018. If you wish to be involved with our <span class="uk-text-bold">FLOW</span> ministry you can <a href="mailto:clint@citychurchmanchester.org">email him</a> or shoot him a text/call at <a href="tel:07508 988 328">07508 988 328</a> with any questions you may have!

            <p>Training is at the <b>heart of our vision</b> at City Church Manchester. We are committed to training and generously giving labourers to resource and plant churches in Manchester, the North West and beyond.</p>
            <p>In addition to our Sunday and Connect midweek training we have Connect Leader training, Service Leader training, the prospective Elder training programme, Deacon training and Ministry Team training.</p>

            <p>From September 2018 we are <b>launching two exciting new training tracks</b>:</p>

            <p><b>Smoke House</b> is our emerging leaders training. This one term course runs alongside Connect Midweek and provides theological grounding for present and future Connect and Ministry Team leaders. We address questions such as who is God, how do we know him, who are we, what did Jesus do, and what is the Church?<p>

            <img src="img/crosslands.png" class="uk-align-right" width=30%/>
            <p><b>Crosslands Training</b> is seminary level theological training. It is a joint initiative between Acts 29 and Oak Hill College to provide non-residential theological training over four years with local tutors groups and 3 residential conferences per year. It enables people to train for set-apart Christian ministry without having to re-locate for residential training. The course provides an accredited MA in Christian Ministry from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Ralph will lead the tutor group in our ministry training centre.</p>
