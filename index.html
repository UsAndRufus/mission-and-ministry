            <h2>NEW OFFICE SPACE</h2>
            <img src="img/office2.jpg" alt="" class="uk-align-right" width="40%">
            <p>As the church grows and we advance more ministries to give support and increase engagement with our city, we have felt a need for <b>more space</b>.</p>

            <p>We are excited to announce that from September we will be gaining an <b>additional office suite</b> in the second floor of Central Hall.</p>

            <p>The plan is to devote one of the new office rooms to <b>administration and operations</b>, whilst the other will become our <b>planting and resourcing</b> base. Both of these areas have seen considerable growth and development over the last 18 months and additional space with make a huge difference in being able to effectively organise the church as well as look towards our vision to resource 50 churches.</p>
            <!-- <img src="img/office1.jpg" alt="" class="uk-align-right" width="40%"> -->

            <h2>NEW MINISTRY TRAINEES</h2>
            <p>We are also excited to be welcome <b>George Platt</b> as a <b>Ministry Trainee</b>. George is a Lancashire lad who has ended up in Mongolia. He studied Chemistry at Durham University and then became a lecturer, but let’s hear him tell us all about it:</p>
            <img src="img/MT.jpg" alt="" class="uk-align-right" width="40%">
            <blockquote>“I currently serve overseas (Mongolia) as a short-term (one year) cross cultural missionary, having been sent by three sending Churches and the missionary fellowship Interserve. My ministry involves lecturing chemistry at an international missionary-founded university (Mongolia International University) which seeks to bring the gospel to students in Mongolia, most of which come from a Buddhist or shamanistic background (though there are sizeable population of Christians and missionary kids at the university too). Hence, beyond lecturing, I mostly involve myself with student outreach, Bible studies, missionary meetings, newsletter writings, mentoring and accountability sessions.”</blockquote>

            <p>George applied to our <b>ministry training scheme</b> because of our heart for church planting and Reformed theology. He also has a deep passion for sharing the gospel with international students and has been involved in the Manchester International Outreach (MIO) team.
            In his spare time George is interested in politics and enjoys being involved in theatre productions. He enjoys cooking, walks and playing his ukulele.</p>

            <p>We’re hoping to appoint one or two more trainees so watch the space for more details.

            <h2>FLOW</h2>
            <img src="img/clint.jpg" class="uk-align-right" width=40%/>
            <p>Membership has always been a <b>key ministry</b> of City Church. But, as the church has grown it is easier than for visitors and even committed attendees to be anonymous or struggle to find a pathway into church life. <b>FLOW</b> ministry exists to equip those attending City Church to enjoy Christ by intentionally providing pathways of <b>integration into the life</b> of the church. Whether that be enjoying Christ in community with believers, enjoying Christ on a service teams, enjoying Christ at midweek connect groups, or enjoying Christ as an official member of City Church, we wish to <b>invite everyone</b> who walks through our doors to <b>enjoy Christ</b> in all aspects of the church.</p>
          <p>
            Practically we run <b>monthly welcome lunches</b>, <b>quarterly membership classes</b>, and act as <b>a hub</b> for social, service team, and ministry connections throughout the church. <b>Clint Harper</b> will be our new Connections Director launching this new ministry officially from September 2018. If you wish to be involved with our <b>FLOW</b> ministry you can <a href="mailto:clint@citychurchmanchester.org">email him</a> or shoot him a text/call at <a href="tel:07508 988 328">07508 988 328</a> with any questions you may have!

            <h2>CHURCH PLANTER</h2>
            <img src="img/pete.jpg" class="uk-align-right" width=40%/>
            <p><b>Pete Evans</b> grew up in Cambridge and studied History at the University of Cardiff. Following graduation, he worked as an Office Manager before being taken on as a <b>trainee minister</b> of a large church in Cardiff. Soon after, he joined the launch team of a church plant in the Welsh Valleys. He then went on to <b>lead a church plant</b> in Pontprennau. For the past two years, Pete has been <b>studying for an MA</b> in Biblical and Theological Studies at Phoenix Seminary. He has a heart for church planting in areas of real gospel and strategic need. Pete is <b>married to Hannah</b> and they have <b>two sons</b>, Jack and Owen.</p>

            <p>Pete is coming on staff at City Church in Autumn 2018 for a period of two years where he will receive <b>training and coaching</b> in <b>pastoral ministry and church planting</b> prior to planting a church in Manchester in 2020. We are committed to resourcing generously the two churches that we directly plant. For this to be possible, there needs to be a close alignment of ministry philosophy and DNA and one of the purposes of the two years is to achieve this alignment so that we can confidently send people, finances and resources with the plant. It is expecting that the church will be financially self-financing within 3 years.</p>

            <h2>PASTORAL WORKER</h2>
            <img src="img/barbara.jpg" class="uk-align-right" width=40%/>
            <p>As a passionate student of the Bible, with the spiritual gifts of teaching, administration, and hospitality, <b>Barbara Wright</b> has ministered to women for over 30 years in Washington, D.C., Miami, Florida, and Tallahassee, Florida.</p>

            <p>In this chapter of her life, Barbara wants to fully implement Acts 1:8, where God encourages His disciples to be “witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth.” Practically, she feels that now is the time to go into the “uttermost part of the earth.” And, in this case, that would be Manchester - definitely a far-cry from the Florida sun!</p>

            <p>From September 2018, Barbara will strategically serve as a <b>pastoral worker</b> in three key areas: women’s shepherding/care, event planning, and administrative and operational support.</p>

            <img src="img/training_day.png" class="uk-align-right" width=40%/>
            <p>Training is at the <b>heart of our vision</b> at City Church Manchester. We are committed to training and generously giving labourers to resource and plant churches in Manchester, the North West and beyond.</p>
            <p>In addition to our Sunday and Connect midweek training we have Connect Leader training, Service Leader training, the prospective Elder training programme, Deacon training and Ministry Team training.</p>


            <img src="img/smokehouse.jpg" class="uk-align-right" width=30%/>
            <p>From September 2018 we are <b>launching two exciting new training tracks</b>:</p>


            <p><em>Smokehouse</em> is our emerging leaders training. This one term course runs alongside Connect Midweek and provides theological grounding for present and future Connect and Ministry Team leaders. We address questions such as who is God, how do we know him, who are we, what did Jesus do, and what is the Church?<p>


            <p><em>Crosslands Training</em> is seminary level theological training. It is a joint initiative between Acts 29 and Oak Hill College to provide non-residential theological training over four years with local tutors groups and <img src="img/crosslands.png" class="uk-align-right" width=30%/>3 residential conferences per year. It enables people to train for set-apart Christian ministry without having to re-locate for residential training. The course provides an accredited MA in Christian Ministry from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Ralph will lead the tutor group in our ministry training centre.</p>

            <h2>STUDENT WORKER</h2>
            <img src="img/alan.jpg" class="uk-align-right" width=40%/>
            <p>We are excited to be welcoming <b>Alan Andrioni</b> to the staff team in September to serve as a <b>student worker</b>. Alan has been included under <b>Affections</b> because, as a student worker, his main goal will be to <b>turn our students' hearts to Christ</b>. As Clint transitions into the new FLOW ministry, Alan will be taking up his role as student worker.</p>

            <p>Alan came to Christ through <b>Campus Outreach</b> ministry in 2005 whilst studying in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he has then ministered for the past 10 years with a focus on <b>evangelism and discipleship</b>. In January 2017 he transitioned to focusing on helping <b>mobilise graduates</b> as laborers to the world, hoping God can multiply his life and ministry to reach Brazil and the nations.
In December 2010 Alan and Junia got married and were later blessed with Enzo in August 2015.</p>
